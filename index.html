            This app cross checks your password with the already leaked and publically available passwords set, without
            compormising yours, using k anonimity model.

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>
            We have a tendency to reuse passwords or use common and easy to remember passwords. So it is a good idea to
            verify that our password is not already exposed during any data breach. If we are using already exposed
            passwords, then you are facing a huge risk of compromising your account to a simple dictionary attack.We
